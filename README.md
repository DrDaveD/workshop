This is the source for the https://sciauth.org/workshop web site, which uses [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

Edit [index.md](index.md) to update the home page.
Use the [2021](2021) subdirectory for content specific to the 2021 workshop, so we can update the home page for future workshops later.
